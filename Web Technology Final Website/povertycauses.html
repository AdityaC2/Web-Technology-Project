        <h2 class = "hed">Climatic Factors</h2>
        <a href = "#cause" onclick="ri1()"><img src="https://www.indiaspend.com/h-upload/old_images/1600x960_344605-flood620.jpg" alt="" class = "img" id = "img1"></a>
        <p class = "para" id = "para1">These conditions constitute an important cause of poverty. The heat which is experienced by the rural
          population causes some barriers in their work due to which their production suffers. Natural calamities such as frequent floods,
          disasters, earthquake and cyclone cause heavy damage to agriculture. Agriculture is stated to be the major occupation of the rural people;
          downfall of agriculture and lack of production will certainly be the major cause of poverty for them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2 class = "hed">Demographic Factors</h2>
        <a href = "#cause" onclick="ri2()"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/805/1*iadSGFMmFC9z-0bmLP8oqw.jpeg" alt="" class = "img" id = "img2"></a>
        <p class = "para" id = "para2">There have been demographic factors which are accountable for the growth of poverty in India. Rapid growth of population aggravates the
          poverty of the people. The growth of population exceeds the rate of growth in national income. Growth of the countryâ€™s population creates
          impediments in the removal of poverty and lowers the per capita income. Economically backward sections of the society and other disadvantaged
          groups are the main sufferers of the reduction in per capita income. Population growth also leads to an increase in labor supply which tends to
          decrease the wage rate.<br><br>
          Another demographic factor is the size of the family. The larger the size of the family, the lower the per capita income and lower is the standard
          of living. This is common more in rural areas than in the urban areas. In rural areas, there is a system of having more joint families in a household.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2 class = "hed">Personal Factors</h2>
        <a href = "#cause" onclick="ri3()"><img src="https://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period1/2013/02/27/Photos/skilledworker--621x414.jpg" alt="" class = "img" id = "img3"></a>
        <p class = "para" id = "para3">There have been a couple of personal factors too which are accountable for the growth of poverty in India. One is lack of motivation, some rural people
          do not inculcate this motivation amongst themselves that they should work hard and achieve something for themselves. They are not even willing to acquire
          some literacy skills and this causes poverty. Second reason is their redundancy, mostly people are indolent, monotonous and unenthusiastic to work and therefore
          live their lives in extreme poverty.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2 class = "hed">Economic Factors</h2>
        <a href = "#cause" onclick="ri4()"><img src="https://www.fairobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Indian-National-Congress-India-Indian-news-poverty-in-India.jpg" alt="" class = "img" id = "img4"></a>
        <p class = "para" id = "para4">First is low agricultural productivity. There is relationship between real income and poverty, increase
          in real income leads to the reduction in poverty. In the agricultural sector, even today the traditional cultivation techniques are being employed by the
          farmers, leading to low productivity and hence resulting in poverty.Second are the unequal distribution of land and other assets, land and other forms of
          assets constitute the main source of income of the rural people. The size wise distribution of operational holdings is vested in the hands of few farmers;
          therefore the other farmers suffer from poverty to a major extent.
          <br><br>Thirdly, there has been a decline of village industries, due to industrialization, new industries and factories are being set up in rural areas,
          village industries are poor in their comparison in terms of quality and productivity, as a result village industries are closing down, in this way, individuals
          employed are losing their jobs and suffering from the conditions of poverty.
          <br><br>Fourthly, there has been immobility of labor, even if they are offered a job with higher wages, they are not willing to leave their homes and travel
          to another place to earn their living and take their conditions as they are.
          <br><br>Finally, there is lack of employment opportunities, unemployment leads to major poverty, because of lack of employment opportunities, people are either
          unemployed or underemployed, small and marginal farmers and landless agricultural laborers constitute unemployed and underemployed population.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2 class = "hed">Social Factors</h2>
        <a href = "#cause" onclick="ri5()"><img src="https://thelogicalindian.com/h-upload/2020/07/20/177503-povertyweb.jpg" alt="" class = "img" id = "img5"></a>
        <p class = "para" id = "para5">First is education, education is stated to be the agent of social change. Poverty is said to be
          closely related to the levels of schooling that the individual has obtained. The earning capacity is endowed within an individual on the basis of the level of
          education that he has attained. People who are illiterate or who have not acquired much education do dwell in the conditions of poverty, and people who are well
          educated do enable to find job opportunities for themselves. People suffer from poverty due to poor investment amongst themselves and they lack the funds for human
          capital investment.
          <br><br>Second is the caste system, caste system in India has always been responsible for rural poverty. The subordination of the low caste people by the high caste
          people has caused the poverty of the former. The caste system in some areas was so rigid that it did not allow the low caste people to render their participation in
          economic development. The caste system comprised of Brahmins (teachers and priests) at the top, at the next level are the Kshatriyas (kings and warriors), next came
          the Vaishyas (traders and merchants) and lastly were the Shudras (unskilled workers) at the bottom. Shudras were not allowed to trade and a Vaishya could earn his bread
          only due to trade.
          <br><br>Third is the joint family system. Joint family system is the family system when two or more nuclear families reside under the common roof, comprising of grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and so forth. Some of the members of the family take undue advantage of living in a joint family by depending upon the income of others. They become idlers and their normal life routine just consists of eating, sleeping and begetting children; in this manner there are few earning members and the family becomes large, hence resulting in poverty.
          <br><br>Fourth are the social customs, rural people spend a large amount of their earnings and savings on social customs such as marriage, birth, death feast and so forth, due to this they lose their savings and earnings and suffer from debt and poverty.
          <br><br>Lastly it is growing indebtedness, in the rural sector most of the rural people depend upon the borrowings from the landlords and money lenders even to meet their consumption requirements. The money lenders charge exorbitant rates of interest and acquire mortgaged lands in order to exploit the poor in case of non-payment of loans. Indebted poor farmers cannot free themselves from the control of the money lenders; in this way their poverty is further highlighted, as a consequence they continue to dwell in poverty for generations because of the debt- trap.</p>
